# Summarizing-Customer-Reviews
This is a project that I have created that has taken over 500,000 reviews of fine foods on Amazon, and I am using this data on an LSTM to summarize these reviews into a more condensed form. The data is in Reviews.csv and there is also a dataset that consists of the same data of these users. The data preprocessing that we have done to make it easier for the model to be able to understand to text includes, removing all alphanumeric values, removing stop words, removing punctuation, lemmanization and lowercasing all of the text.
